# LL3D [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5099p8c414wdjib8?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/litianqi/ll3d)

A Mini C++/DirectX11 3D game engine (study project).

## Status

Sadly, this project is ended.

After years of C++ development, I'm tired of normal 'good' C++ style and think Golang/Pythonic style is what I love and what I wanna transform C++ to.

Besides a DirectX-only/platform-dependent engine is not competitive one, good engine should create a layor beyond platform-dependent graphics API. This engine is and always is a DirectX study project, so it's time to end as I have learnt all DirectX APIs.
